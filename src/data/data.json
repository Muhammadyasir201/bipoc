Many well-intentioned sourcing pilots that target marginalized producers can fail because of blind spots. When BIPOC producers are promised sales that fail to materialize due to flawed pilot design, companies can worsen inequities in the food system and cause deeply damaging breakdowns in trust that can have ripple effects for other pilots. Companies should acknowledge the power they hold and commit themselves to the appropriate preparations to avoid such an outcome. <br /> <br />In a <strong>connected market</strong>, producers are empowered to deliver high-quality goods at a fair price that support both their communities and the marketplace. By becoming a partner in this relationship, food purchasers can source ingredients that champion a food system aligned with their values. <br /><br />Participating in a connected market requires not just being educated but becoming involved. Using this tool will help food purchasers learn more about the ingredients they source and how to ask the right questions to create a BIPOC sourcing pilot that supports a just economy.<br /><br />A connected market is a mindful market. </div>",

Buyers who engage in Just Sourcing recognize that conventional, “business as usual” approaches to procurement lock out many small, midsize, regenerative, and BIPOC producers.

Companies and organizations who seek to support BIPOC suppliers via procurement should engage with learning about the history of regional and national food system policies and practices and the cumulative impacts on Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian producers.</div>"
